<h2>About us</h2>

This Project was called to life as I got a bit annoyed about how despite popular, the species seemed very niche and I had trouble to find artists to draw my beautiful boy. Adding to that I wanted to build my own Protogen, lacking any ressources to the exact process with tutorials or materials required. So I've decided to gather it all in one place.
